<p>
My name is Jason Lynch and I am a senior at SUNY Plattsburgh studying in Broadcast Journalism and TV Video Production.
I am interested in several aspects of the communication department at Plattsburgh, which I have taken many classes to help develop my skills. 
These classes include News Reporting, Television Production, Sportscasting, being a DJ for radio, and several others. I look forward to getting more experience 
with job oppurtunities to help further improve my skills.
